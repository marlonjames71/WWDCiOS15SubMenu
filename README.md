# WWDCiOS15SubMenu

I made this little repo cause I caught a glimpse of the sweet new `Menu` animations, more specifically the submenu animations, and I had to check it out.

#### Some other things I dabbled with in this project:
- New button system (`buttonStyle`, `tint`)
- Foreground Styles
- Material Backgrounds
